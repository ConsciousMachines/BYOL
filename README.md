# Build Your Own Lisp
C# implementation of Daniel Holden's "Build Your Own Lisp"

The goal of this project is to use C# in order to focus on language features rather than memory allocation and string processing. This implementation passes all the tests in the book. It will be finished once I get the Y-combinator working.
